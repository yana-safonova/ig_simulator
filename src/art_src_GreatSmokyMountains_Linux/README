COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

	PREREQUISITES: 

		1) GNU g++ 4.0 or above (http://gcc.gnu.org/install) 
		2) GNU gsl library (http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl/)

	COMPILATION & INSTALLATION
		1) add gsl library installation directory to compiler's search path

	       	If your GSL library is not installed in system standard search path, your GSL installation 
		directory need to be added to gcc/g++ complier FLAGS. For example, gsl is typically installed
	       	in /opt/local or /usr/local directory in MacOS X. You can add the directory to the search path
		 of gcc/g++ complier by run the following command: 
		
		export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/opt/local/include" CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I/opt/local/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L/opt/local/lib"
		export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I/usr/local/include" CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L/usr/local/lib"

		2) compile and install 

		./configure --prefix=$HOME
	       	make
	       	make install
